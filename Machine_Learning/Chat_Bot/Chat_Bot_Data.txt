Marketing Fundamentals



What is marketing?



The technique through which a company encourages the acquisition or sale of a product or service is known as marketing. Advertising, selling, and delivering things to customers or other businesses are all marketing examples.






History of Marketing



During the Industrial Revolution, marketing concepts as we know them now first emerged. This period lasted from the late 18th century to the early 19th century. It was a period of tremendous societal transformation spurred on by scientific and technical advancements.






Future of Marketing



Marketing can alter history. It can increase consciousness, modify perspectives, compel action, and even initiate movements. While marketing rarely aspires to such heights, it concentrates on the sale of goods.






Consumer Behaviour



The study of how individuals decide what they purchase, desire, need, or do about a product, service, or corporation is known as consumer behaviour. Understanding consumer behaviour is essential for predicting how potential customers react to a new product or service.






Market Segmentation



Conducting a market segmentation analysis and committing to a long-term market segmentation plan is a difficult and time-consuming process for any company. This course walks you through the whole market segmentation study process and approaches effective and organised consumer segmentation.






Pricing Strategies



Learn and practise concepts and tactics and handle the most current thinking on evaluating and designing pricing strategies. After finishing this training course, you can participate in developing price plans for your services and products and those of your firm.






What are brands?



A brand is an intangible marketing or commercial idea that allows people to recognise a firm, a product, or a person. People frequently mistake brands with marketing tools such as logos, slogans, or other recognised markings used for advertising goods and services.






Why Brands Matter?



Branding is important because it sets you apart from your competition and provides your clients with a point in buying from you. Brand equity is built via consistent, purposeful branding. The promise you make to your consumer is your brand.






Developing new products and Brands



The process of bringing a new product to market is known as new product development. Changes in customer tastes, increased competition, and technological advancements may force your company to participate in this process, or it may be necessary to seize a new opportunity.






Product Life Cycle



The phrase product life cycle refers to when a product is launched to the market and taken off the shelves. Introduction, growth, maturity, and decline are the four stages of a product's life cycle.






Marketing lifecycle



Lifecycle marketing encourages you to thoroughly assess each stage of the customer experience, allowing you to arrange behaviour in a way that results in profit, client loyalty, and recommendations in this ever-changing marketplace.




S.E.O. Fundamentals



SEO



The practice of boosting your website's exposure on prominent search engines like Google and Bing is known as search engine optimisation (SEO).






Why SEO Matters?



SEO is about more than just search engines; it also improves a website's usability and user experience. Users trust search results and having a website that shows in the top results for the phrases the user is looking for adds credibility to the website.






On-Page SEO

Search for Voice

Images Search



You'll learn how image size on your website affects image rendering, and you'll be able to create ideal social media posts that render perfectly no matter which social network you're posting on. By generating perfectly, you'll have a nicer post that attracts more engagement and traffic to your website.

S.E.O. Cheat Sheet



When it comes to SEO, there are numerous factors to consider to keep your website updated. The SEO cheat sheet includes a sorted list of best practices to assist you with the technical side of On-Page SEO.




Marketing Analysis



Why Analysis Matter



You can utilise your data regarding your marketing in SEO analytics. When your website ranks for a keyword, you look at what visitors search for or check at the ranking positions of data on other websites.






KPI's



You'll learn how KPIs specifically assist in determining a company's strategic, financial, and operational accomplishments, particularly when compared to competitors in the same industry.
